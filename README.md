Lots of great stuff's happening here - have fun!

Right now, it is tested working on Mac OS X and mostly working on Linux.

## Install

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/jacobwg/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

If you don't have ruby yet, run `./bootstrap` to setup rbenv, then install a ruby before `rake install`.

Mac Stuff:
